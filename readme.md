# Bare Conductive Simple Touch Board sketch
Processing sketch that simply prints when the electrodes of the [Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/) are touched and released. 

## Requirements

* [Processing](http://www.processing.org/download) 3.0+
* [DataStream](https://github.com/BareConductive/mpr121/tree/public/MPR121/Examples/DataStream) (running on [Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/))
 

## Install

1. Close the Processing IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/simple_touch_board_sketch/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **simple_touch_board** folder and move it to **Processing Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Processing
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Processing	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Processing
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Processing


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Processing IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
